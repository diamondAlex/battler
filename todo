final dungeon xp needs to be calculated for dungeon lvl and split over the 1-4 units on the board
use different border colors on structs to indicate the struct level (black -> bronze -> silver -> gold)
right panel on board should display the list of moves/attacks done in a bg2 style, stats can be displayed on hover
names have to fit gender
dungeon background image shouldn't be the map image.
make a simulation module to run fake games (for balance and also to see if data stays ok during long games)
change the alerts() for dialog pop ups with their own style
limit the image use for characters to 1.
Boss dungeon
the bank can't give money on rest otherwise it's an infinite money loop, it should probably just be on the idler
units need to be moved to the right panel when a map in idler is removed
