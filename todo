generate background images for dungeon, make them correspond with the smaller maps images
disable the board button when no dungeons are up
disable other buttons when on board

change the alerts() for dialog pop ups with their own style
limit the image use for characters to 1.
player creation
add panels to see player resources both from maps and units
the maps overlay is bad, rewrite it.

resize all portrait to fit correctly
use drag and drop (yay!) to reorder units in the units tab
