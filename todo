CURRENT:
    there's a confirm() in there that has to be converted to a dialog popup 
    display hp as HP/MAXHP
    style the dialog, add enter as a lister to close the dialog
    units need to be moved to the right panel when a map in idler is removed
    dungeon background image shouldn't be the map image.

LOW PRIO:
    the images in the unit tabs somehow end up being different width
    remove displayInfo() and have custom function for each display needs and please dont make it dependant on key position
    split the image by type and class

LATER:
    make a simulation module to run fake games (for balance and also to see if data stays ok during long games)
    limit the image use for characters to 1.
    the bank can't give money on rest otherwise it's an infinite money loop, it should probably just be on the idler
    final dungeon xp needs to be calculated for dungeon lvl and split over the 1-4 units on the board
    use different border colors on structs to indicate the struct level (black -> bronze -> silver -> gold)
    right panel on board should display the list of moves/attacks done in a bg2 style, stats can be displayed on hover
    Boss dungeon
