the spell selection shouldn't reset every round
the bank can't give money on rest otherwise it's an infinite money loop, it should probably just be on the idler
the levelup system doesn't work at all
final dungeon xp needs to be calculated for dungeon lvl and split over the 1-4 units on the board
instead of accepting quests on click, show them in the right panel. Quests are gonna come in fast and should be dismissable
make blueprints to be generated from blueprints array (in data), that way a blueprint will either lvl up an existing building, or create one from the blueprint
use different border colors on structs to indicate the struct level (black -> bronze -> silver -> gold)
right panel on board should display the list of moves/attacks done in a bg2 style, stats can be displayed on hover
names have to fit gender
having 2 of the same struct in the buy list will filter them both out if you buy one
fix in battle healing so that units can only be brought back between levels
lock all events while animations are happening
there's still issues with the enter window event on the creation page. Like, it will be called if there's something missing, like name or image
leaving should run postDungeon if the dungeon is not done
death bugs the next dungeon.
having multiple quests with the same name pops all of them (from the quest page)
generate background images for dungeon, make them correspond with the smaller maps images
serialization of game data for reload purposes
make a build to run longer games on, in order to test things beyond the very beginning
change the alerts() for dialog pop ups with their own style
limit the image use for characters to 1.
player creation
add panels to see player resources both from maps and units
the maps overlay is bad, rewrite it.
the quests are dubious. You get a new dungeon in order to find a dungeon? Maybe make is a special one time dungeon?
resize all portrait to fit correctly
use drag and drop (yay!) to reorder units in the units tab
REFACTOR NAMES BRO WTF
the town image is too boring, replace it
the spell dialog would look better popping up beside the slot
