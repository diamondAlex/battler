leaving should run postDungeon if the dungeon is not done
death bugs the next dungeon.
having multiple quests with the same name pops all of them (from the quest page)
generate background images for dungeon, make them correspond with the smaller maps images
serialization of game data for reload purposes
make a build to run longer games on, in order to test things beyond the very beginning
change the alerts() for dialog pop ups with their own style
limit the image use for characters to 1.
player creation
add panels to see player resources both from maps and units
the maps overlay is bad, rewrite it.
the quests are dubious. You get a new dungeon in order to find a dungeon? Maybe make is a special one time dungeon?
resize all portrait to fit correctly
use drag and drop (yay!) to reorder units in the units tab
REFACTOR NAMES BRO WTF
